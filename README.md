I'm Kevin Patel, and I am enthusiastic about robotics and mainly robot perception. I enjoy learning new concepts in machine learning and computer vision. I use PyTorch as the main framework for machine learning projects. I do coding in Python and work with Robot Operating System (ROS).

Skills: Python / ROS / PyTorch / Computer Vision / Machine Learning / Robot Perception
